# Department Interaction
User Story: I can view the degree of interaction between departments

This report tells me: 
- Number of message threads created and replied to
- Breakdown of departments replying to threads created by a single department
- Percentage of all messages threads created and replied to, by department

All views in this report can be filtered by AD location. 

By default, last 12 weeks' data is displayed. This can extend to 52 weeks in the filter; the date period is indicated in the top right of the report.
