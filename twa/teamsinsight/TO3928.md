# Governance Reporter
User Story: I can find out which teams are out of compliance and donâ€™t follow best practice

This report tells me:

- Whether a team is public or private
- Team archive status
- Teams with duplicate names or empty descriptions
- Number of channels per team
- Whether messages were posted within the last 30 days
- Teams without owners
- Number of guests per team

Multiple filters enable granular analysis of team details, owners, members and guests, with traffic light guidance to indicate risk.
