# User Activity
User Story: I can view activity per user or guest, and compare with the average number of chat and Teams messages, calls and meetings

This report tells me:

- Whether a user is active or not
- Average chat and teams messages, calls and meetings (last 3 weeks or months)
- A summary of activity by users vs guests
- Number of teams joined by each user
- Number of chat and Teams messages, calls and meetings per user

Filter by team, country, city, office and department. 

Review last calendar week or month by switching between 'WEEKLY' AND 'MONTHLY' tabs.
