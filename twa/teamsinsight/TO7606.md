# Usage Change
User Story: I can view the change in number of users and types of activity

This report tells me: 
- Increase/decrease over time for active users, chat and teams messages, calls and meetings
- Graphic depiction of change per month across all modalities and users

All views in this report can be filtered by AD location. 

Review week on week or month on month change by switching between 'WEEKLY' AND 'MONTHLY' tabs.
