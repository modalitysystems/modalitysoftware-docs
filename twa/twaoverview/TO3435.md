# User Activity
User Story: I can view activity per user or guest, and compare with the average number of chat and teams messages, calls and meetings

This report tells me:

- Whether a user is active or not
- Average chat and teams messages, calls and meetings (last 3 months)
- A summary of activity by users vs guests
- Number of Teams joined by each user
- Number of chat and Teams messages, calls and meetings per user

Filter by team, country, city, office and department.
