# Governance Reporter (Users)
User Story: I can find out which teams are out of compliance and donâ€™t follow best practice, filtering by user type (owner, member, guest) or guest domain

This report tells me:

- Which of an owners' teams are public or private
- Which teams a guest is part of 
- Archive status of teams joined 
- Whether an owner's teams have duplicate names or empty descriptions
- Number of channels per team
- Whether team members posted messages within the last 30 days
- Teams without owners
- Number of guests per team, by guest domain

Multiple filters enable granular analysis of team details, owners, members and guests, with traffic light guidance to indicate risk.
