# How to Configure Task Scheduler Reminders for Teamwork Analytics Notification Service *

The Notification Service will create several Task Schedules to run each notification reminder. Some will be configured to run once a month and others, such as the deleted team reminder, will run daily by default.

These can be configured by the Windows Task Scheduler which you can achieve by following the steps bellow.

## Configuring Task Scheduler

This process requires access to the virtual machine that you have [deployed Teamwork Analytics](README.md) onto.

1. Open Windows Task Scheduler and select **Task Scheduler Library** on the left panel. You should see a list of Reminder Schedules set to run on their respective dates.

  >Task Scheduler can be found in the start menu in the *Windows Administrative Tools* folder.

  >Alternatively you can run `"taskschd.msc"`.
