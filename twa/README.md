# Modality Systems Teamwork Analytics

Modality Systemsâ€™ Teamwork Analytics supports organisations with hundreds of thousands of Microsoft Teams users all over the world, driving adoption and managing the entire lifecycle of Teams to ensure best practice, governance, and security.

Teamwork Analytics combines a native Microsoft Teams app for team creation and lifecycle management through automation and Power BI reporting.

In preview is reporting for Microsoft PSTN Billing reporting. This module is deployed in select enterprise customers and provides full PSTN billing reports for Microsoft Teams calling plans and PSTN Audio Conferencing. This is currently bespoke reporting on a per customer basis.

Teamwork Analytics can be run by Modality Systems in Azure as software as a service (SaaS) or on a customer azure tenant (CAT).

This documentation gives full details of the deployment and configuration of Teamwork Analytics

> Some reports in Teamwork Analytics can be affected by an admin centre setting, see [here](TWA-FAQ.md#is-teamwork-analytics-effected-by-the-hide-user-details-in-reports-setting) for details.

# Teamwork Analytics - SaaS

As a global dedicated Microsoft Systems Integrator, Independent Software Vendor (ISV) and Cloud Solutions Provider (CSP) with 11 Gold competencies and multiple Global Partner of the Year awards, we are happy to offer Teamwork Analytics as a service run from Microsoft Azure.

Customers will need to grant access from their Office 365 tenant and each person at the customer that wants to review Power BI reporting will need Power BI Professional (just for users looking at reporting, not all users).

This is the quickest and easiest way to run Teamwork Analytics

# Teamwork Analytics -  Customer Azure Tenant (CAT)

For customers that have requirements to keep data and control within their own Microsoft tenant, Modality Systems fully supports Teamwork Analytics being deployed on customer azure tenant (CAT) via Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

This allows Teamwork Analytics to be deployed without Modality Systems having any access to customer data.
