# Trend Report - Per User Activity Daily

User Story: I can find out the average number of Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings per User, per day of the week including weekends.

This report tells me:

- How the level of activity fluctuates over the course of a week
- The mix of User activity, and whether patterns correlate between modalities
- Each trend line can be analysed to show which factor(s) most influenced day-to-day change

Daily moving average can be used to review peak activity days and understand weekend working.
