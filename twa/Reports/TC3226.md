# Guest Details

User Story: I can find out about teams with Guests, the domain they come from and the files they have access to. 

This report tells me:

- Who owns teams with Guests
- Number of teams each Guest is a member of 
- How many Messages a Guest has sent
- Number of Guests and Messages by Guest domain
- Team Visibility (Public/Private/Hidden), to determine risk of accidental data exposure
- Archive and Message status

Drill through to view Users and Attributes by team and domain, and details of files Guests have access to.
