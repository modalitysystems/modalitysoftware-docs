# Office Collaboration Activity

User Story: I can find out about the level of collaboration per Office and view averages and running totals for comparison. 

This report tells me

- Weekly Channel average of messages, mentions and reactions per User (top 10 Offices)
- Running total of messages per week, per Office (top 10 Offices)
- Number of teams posted in, new threads created, messages and replies

Drill-through provides a list of Users and Attributes, teams distribution, Channel averages and running total of messages for the selected Office.
