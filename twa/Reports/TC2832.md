# Team Files

User Story: I can find out about the number and type of files in all teams, and view Team Details for last modified date and file size. 

This report tells me:

- How many files in teams per file type
- The number of teams by file count (banded 1-50, 51-100, 101-500, 501-1000, >1000)
- Details of files, per team

View number of files by type, including email message, text file, PNG, PDF. 

Review number and percentage of teams by the number of files in each. 

Teams File Details lists every team with files, and details total number of files, files modified within the last 30 days, date of last file modification and file size.
