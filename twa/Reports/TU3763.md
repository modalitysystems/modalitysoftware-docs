# Trend Report - Activity Counts Monthly

User Story: I can find out how many Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings there are per month and review change over time.

This report tells me:

- Average daily number and monthly total per modality
- Whether there's a pattern of engagement over the last 6 months, indicating behavioural change or emerging trends

Trend lines can be compared with Monthly Active Users to understand periods of low or high activity within the User base, and filtered to Country, City, Department or Location for deeper analysis. Month on month behaviour can be used for forecasting.
