# Governance Reporter

User Story: I can find out which teams are out of compliance and don't follow best practice.

This report tells me: 

- Whether a team is public/private/hidden
- Team archive status
- Teams with duplicate names or empty descriptions
- Number of channels per team
- Whether messages were posted within the last 30 days
- Teams without owners
- Number of guests per team

Multiple filters enable granular analysis of team details, owners, members and guests, with traffic light guidance to indicate risk.
