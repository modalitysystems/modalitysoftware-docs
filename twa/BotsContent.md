## Default Bot Scenarios and Content
Below are the default Bot scenarios deployed with TWA, if you have selected to include the notification service.

For each scenario you will find a description of the scenario and any default configured values. For each scenario we are able to configure the **Message Subject** and **Message Content.**

Please email Software.Support@modalitysystems.com if you require any customisation to the default scenarios or wish to discuss additional scenarios.

### Default Message Behaviour ###
If a scenario is triggered and the message sent, this will initially be delivered via email, as per the examples below. Within each default message, we provide the end user the ability to recieve future messages via the Teamwork Tips Bot. This is achieved by clicking the link provided within the message.
