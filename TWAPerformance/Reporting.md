# Teams Performance Reporting Notes

Total Call counts in aggregated data are calculated per modality by counting any call with a duration more than 1 MilliSecond in that modality. Total Duration In Minutes per modality is calculated by summing the total MilliSeconds of each call in that modality then dividing by 60,000 and rounding up to the minute. As such some discrepancies might be found when comparing between other reports, due to rounding up.
