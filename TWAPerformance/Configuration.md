# Teams Diagnostics Configuration Notes

## Application Insights

### Data Sampling Ratio
By Default we have set up Application Insights with Ingestion Sampling at 12.5% to minimise costs. This should be reviewed after a two weeks of install and increased if possible. Detail about ingestion sampling can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/sampling#ingestion-sampling)

Moving to Adaptive Sampling is in the product roadmap.

### Data Retention
By Default, data retention is set to 90 days as this incurs no additional cost ([see Application Insights section here for details](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/monitor/)). This should not be changed.

## Storage Accounts

### Blob Storage Retention 
Data retention is handled by a rule in the Storage accounts Lifecycle Management. The default value is 14 Days. You can learn more [here](https://aka.ms/LifecycleManagement).

### Table Storage Retention
Data retention is handled by an azure timer function running every 5 minutes. There is a configuration setting called `RetentionPeriodInDays` to set the retention period. The default value is 14 days.

## SQL Database

### Data Retention
Data retention is handled by an azure timer function running every minute. It currently affects the Calls and Streams tables. There is a configuration setting called `SqlDataRetentionPeriodInDays` to set the retention period. The default value is 14 days.
