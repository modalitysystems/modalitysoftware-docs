Following the section above, you should have a valid certificate which will now be used to upload against the app registration. So the next step is go to the app registration and follow the steps below:

1. When the app registration has loaded, go to the "certificates & secrets" section and select the "Upload certificate" button underneath the "Certificates" header

1. Browse to the directory containing the .cer certificate file recently created, and select "Ok". The import should work and you upload should show against the app registration

It is unlikely that you have uploaded the wrong certificate, but you can verify by checking that the "Thumbprint" values matches on both the uploaded certificate and the one created in KeyVault.
